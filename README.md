# Featured Image Sharpen Up

Featured Image Sharpen Up makes a tiny version of your featured post image and places it in the head of the page.
As you scroll down the page, some JavaScript lazy loads the featured images in the background and replaces the tiny images as the full images are loaded.

You may have seen a similar effect used for images on medium.com.

Created on WordPress 4.4, but should work on earlier versions.
Tested working on all Twenty Sixteen, Twenty Fifteen, Twenty Fourteen, Twenty Thirteen, Twenty Twelve and Twenty Eleven themes. Should work on other themes, but may need CSS adjustments, depending on theme handling of featured images.

Uses jQuery.Lazy(); (http://jquery.eisbehr.de/lazy/) and Hugh Lashbrooke's plugin template (https://github.com/hlashbrooke/WordPress-Plugin-Template)
